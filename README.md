Abstract— heart diseases are one of the most prevalent pathologies around the world, making their treatment a public health problem. Since some of these diseases share symptoms and physiopathology, it isn’t uncommon to find patients with similar comorbidities and characteristics. The objective of this project is to explore how these different characteristics and symptoms coexist in patients with heart disease using data and network science, and hopefully reach some conclusions on the most common and important traits.
